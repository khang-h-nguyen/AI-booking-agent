# üí¨ MedMe Virtual Assistant (Voice & Chat)

This is a voice-first medical assistant built with **Retell AI**, designed for **MedMe Pharmacies**. It handles bookings, rescheduling, and cancellations over the phone or via embedded chat. The assistant integrates with **Cal** for scheduling and **Make** for backend workflows like logging and appointment updates.

## 1. Architecture & Key Components

- **Agent Type**: Single Prompt Voice Agent via Retell AI

## 2. Tools & Why They Were Chosen

| Tool          | Use Case                         | Reason |
|---------------|----------------------------------|--------|
| **Retell AI** | Voice agent + chat widget        | Recommended, real-time audio/chat integration |
| **Cal**       | Booking calendar                 | Native Retell function support(check_availability_cal, book_appointment_cal) |
| **Make.com**  | Automation (reschedule, cancel flows)| Flexible, event-based automation |
| **Google Calendar/Cal Bookings** | Data review for chat sessions | Retell doesn't capture `{{phone}}` in chat, only in audio |

## 3. Error Handling Approach

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Time unavailable | Suggest next 3 available slots using `check_availability_cal` |
| Missing phone (in chat) | Prompt user: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best number to reach you at?‚Äù ‚Üí store as `user_phone` |
| User wants to reschedule/cancel a booking that is not theirs | Prompt user: "Are you sure you didn't book under a different number?" |

---

## 4. "If I Had More Time..."

- Tweak the prompt or the built-in Cal-integrated functions because sometimes it would need another response from the user before calling the functions.
- Handle cases where the user needs to be redirected to a real person via different phone number/email if the AI cannot solve what the user wants/system down.
- Build a better pipeline to import data straight into google sheets after the chat ends.

## 5. To Test
